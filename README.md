# Fire-Sense
An automatic fire alarm system provides real-time surveillance, monitoring, and automatic alarm. An automatic fire alarm system based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. To provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors that periodically measure smoke concentration or temperature are deployed in buildings. This project will present the technique we used to detect fire. This technique includes fire detection using image processing and sensors, fire detection using CCTV technology, and Fire detection using GSM and GPS with sms and call alerts.
